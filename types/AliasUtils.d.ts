 * fall back to `all` to keep declaration-order semantics across buckets.
 * The `useBuckets` flag is true only when bucketing would actually help —
 * i.e. there are at least 2 distinct first chars AND no empty-prefix
 * wildcard. When false, the resolve hot path skips the `Map.get` and
 * iterates `all` directly with the per-option first-char-code screen
 * (matching the pre-bucketing behavior). This avoids paying for `Map.get`
 * on degenerate single-bucket lists like a long chain of aliases that
 * all share one first char — the bucket lookup adds overhead without
 * narrowing the candidate set, which showed up as a transient-memory
 * regression on `pathological-deep-stack`.
